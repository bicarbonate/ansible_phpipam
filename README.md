# ansible_phpipam
An inventory script I developed for querying a PHpipam DB and providing Ansible ready JSON output

Using this script has a couple requirements:

1. Ansible Automation Platform controller, Tower or AWX
2. Creating a Custom credential type that includes the following Env Injectors:
    env:
  IPAM_DBHOST: '{{ host }}'
  IPAM_DBPASS: '{{ password }}'
  IPAM_DBUSER: '{{ username }}'
3. You create a Project, then an Inventory with a source `from Project`
4. On the PhpIpam side: I am using custom fields in lieu of tags to filter IPAddresses that I want to manage.
    So there are custom_fields on IPAddresses and Subnets, so I can filter based on both. Your situation
    might differ, adjust the query accordingly.
5. Make sure the .py is executable
    
For testing this outside of AAP, it's as easy and running the script. However inside of AAP there are some hurdles,
since AAP utilizes containers at Job runtime you must do a few things. Mount the container or Execution Environment you intend
to use in the AAP Inventory Source, start a bash session within it, manually set the ENV variables then run it.

Provided you see JSON output, then it should work fine within AAP. 

In my situation I encountered a month's worth of problems that ultimately were resolved by changing teh credential used, 
then switching back to the original. Even RH support had no clue why.
